 * This class will control what the NPC will say. Essentially the NPCâ€™s will
 * assist the user in the game by giving them clues or request that they
 * complete the quest. The NPC will only say specific sentences based on the
 * users progress in the game(how many quests they have achieved and their stats
 * like health, toxin level etc.). There are a series of things the NPC could
 * say . This class breaks down those options and output certain information.
