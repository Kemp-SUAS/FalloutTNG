# FalloutTNG
Fallout The New Generation Where no vault boy has gone before.

This program is a fan re-creation of the 19 year old game Fallout. With some changes of course.
Our take on this buitifull game will feature lore-friendly content that will bring any old fallout player to exitment.
Our rich dialog option will make your gameplay so good that youll want to stop playing this and play fallout 4 instead. Just joking you will
come back for more becasue of the heavy lore content.This game will feature your very own vault boy/girl that you can cusomize.
Please dont sue us as we are doing this for a school assignment. Thanks bethesda todd howard is god. all hail todd howard. Without
further notice here is our uml diagram and design document.
