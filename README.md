# FalloutTNG
Fallout The New Generation, where no vault boy has gone before.

This program is a fan re-creation of the 19 year old game Fallout, with some unique changes.
Our take on this history rich and action packed game will feature lore-friendly content that will bring excitement to any player.
The rich dialog options will create dynamic game play that will continue to attract players to enjoy this diverse game. 
Extensive amounts of lore will allow any true gaming fan to follow the story of a vault dweller through out his journey to a post apocalyptic world. This game features customizable character creation allowing the player to journey through the world as if it was themselves.
This school project encourages us to follow in the path of a very unique and well made game and test our skills of programming and working as a team. Our UML diagram and design document can be seen below.

-----To-Do list-----

-Complete the DGEDS(Dynamic game engine database structure). The DGEDS will dynamically load and create levels based on pre-made constants stored in a database.

-Complete dynamic asset handling. This is going to be a complete overhaul of the asset handling classes. All the string constants will be stored a database which we can put information of off quite easily and dynamically.

-Finish the wiki web site and blog made using the bootstrap framework and the trusty sublime text. 

-Start working on the web site being controlled using JSP and create a servelet application that will dynamically change the blog and wiki of the web site.

-Keep an updated and well kept Wiki web site. 

-Create a fluid flow between rendered and character packages.

-Create dynamic and unique art.
